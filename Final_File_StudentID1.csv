I agree with Erik. This Issue (and all others with the ""create flowchart"" part in their name) should have a flowchart created in Camunda to accompany them. We decided to include those flowcharts only for the less simple processes, so not all Issues of this type have that text, but the ones that do should include a flowchart.

1. User begins on the Home page.
1. User views About page.
1. The user navigates to the Qualification page via the Navbar, where they initially view an empty table of Qualifications.
1. The user opens a ""create"" component to create a Java Qualification and receives a successful 200 HTTP 1. The response includes the newly created Java Qualification in JSON format.
1. The create component closes automatically, and the user is brought back to the Qualification page, where the Java Qualification now appears in the table.
1. The user clicks on the Java Qualification, causing the table item to expand and reveal the Qualification details, fetched through a GET 1. The details displayed include a table of Workers assigned to this Qualification, which is currently empty.
1. The user repeats the creation process for a Security Qualification.
1. This new Security Qualification appears in the table on the Qualification page, following another successful 200 HTTP response.
1. The user clicks on the Security Qualification, which collapses any previously expanded Qualification details and shows the details for 1. This detail view also shows an empty table of Workers.
1. The user attempts to create a qualification with an invalid name and receives a 400 HTTP response, with an error message explaining the invalid name issue.
1. Upon returning to the Qualifications table, the table remains unchanged as the invalid Qualification was not added.
1. The user successfully creates a third Qualification named Experience, which then appears on the Qualification page sorted alphabetically.
1. The user navigates to the Worker page using the Navbar and views an initially empty table of Workers.
1. The user creates a Worker named John Doe, who has the Java and Security Qualifications, receiving a 200 response with the details in JSON format.
1. After returning to the Worker page, the user now sees John Doe listed among the Workers.
1. Upon clicking on John Doe, the Worker details expand to show an empty table of Projects and the two assigned Qualifications: Java and Security Certified.
1. The user then attempts to create a Worker named Pax Shirone without any Qualifications, but receives a 400 response indicating that a Worker cannot be created without Qualifications.
1. The user returns to the Worker page, which still only lists John Doe.
1. The user navigates back to the Qualification page via the Navbar, where the three previously created Qualifications are visible.
1. Clicking on the Java Qualification now shows John Doe listed in the associated Workers.
1. Repeating this for the Security Qualification also shows John Doe listed.
1. Finally, viewing the details of the Experience Qualification reveals an empty Worker table, indicating no Workers have been assigned this Qualification yet.",3,2,28,6

Yeah, I was having a hard time reading it as well while verifying, haha.
I think the only ones I noticed that should've been exceptions were those two: 14-ii-c-a and 14-ii-c-c. There were also a few more partitions of the Project name (like the purely whitespace one) but those should be caught and handled by the Project constructor, right?",3,3,195,4

I tried commenting it out and the tests still passed.

So Project.getWorkers().contains(Jack) checks if worker is in the project worker, but the methods I need( isAvalible() and .getQualifications()) are both returning null no matter what. I have null cases on some of the tests that aren't supposed to be null which is the reason why everything is catching. That would be my bad I thought I could leave the expect null even if it's not. | > Also, in ""if (workers != null || !(workers.isEmpty()))"", what is the purpose of "" || !(workers.isEmpty())""?

I did it, because I was thinking of what if workers comes in empty. Didn't think it through that it would still return an empty string and wouldn't need to go and create a new empty Hashset",8,2,143,0

-last name resilience
 | So I addressed the issue where it was causing problems if there was no last name (when the app tried to alphabetize). 

I spent a bunch of time trying to problems solve the issue with the qualifications not updating. However this is unresolved. I did add some lines to the createWorker test (you can see that in this PR). The tests show that the qualification is not updating when we create a worker with that qualification. I don't know where the problem is exactly, but I suspect that it's in the server side. I will create an issue for that, but I don't think that the problem is with this PR. 

I will note that the Qualifications page will need to figure out what will trigger it to refresh its data. I started on that but realized that the qualification data didn't seem to be updating (it wasn't just that the page wasn't reloading new data). 

Also, it seems like we did no tests for api/qualifications , where we return the whole set of qualificationDTOs for the company. I guess it's working OK, as we're able to get them from our app, but just noting that I only see tests in the RestController test file for when we also pass on a specific description.

I am still trying to understand what PUT request is doing. The only thing I understand so far is that PUT endpoint is sent by client, unlike POST and GET is from the server, but I might be wrong. The line you mentioned,  ""if(request.params(""name"").equals(projectDTO.getName()))"", is to check that the request name from the client match the name in database, if the name matches the name in the database, then we start the project. However, I am not sure am I doing it right or not. I will go ask TA on Monday and once I understand how it work I will implement the rest of endpoints with test cases on Monday, so I can help improving the test cases. | @Peter0924

Essentially, Spotbugs is saying that some of the getters in our DTO classes are exposing mutable objects, and the private variables could be changed in ways that we don't expect this way. I have tried to change all of getters in the DTO files where this is an issue with this PR. I have not touched any test files. 
Spotbugs is also complaining about the setter functions. I don't think we should address that.... The setters are public ways to change these private variables anyway, so I don't see how we could make it better. Open to pushback on that!
Spotbugs also has similar issues with some of our main class files.  I will open a separate issue for that. 
 I will watch for your feedback before plowing into these other changes.  | I guess that without doing any copying with the setter, the private variable could be affected by changes in the input variable, potentially bypassing the setter. I guess I'll make an issue for that too.  | @oroconnor I like the approach used where you create deep-copies of each array instead of returning the shallow-copy, as I thought that was what's causing the issue. The only concern I have is that I ran Spotbugs on your branch and it says the BugInstance still exsists for these DTO methods. So I am not sure what else to try.  | It looks like Spotbugs was happy with the mutable object fix, but then was complaining about my inefficient array copying, which is why the bugs number wasn't going down. I adjusted these methods, and now bug number went from 39 to 33.

More importantly, while the code covers this overload situation, the ISP and the tests don't test what would happen if the worker is available currently, but assigning the project would cause over load. I think that needs to be added. For example. Worker workload is 11 (so they are available), but the project is Project.BIG size, so it would overload them.

Thanks for pointing that out! I need some time to fix it since ISP table and BCC needs to be updeated as well | I agree with Owen. I think that the ""size"" of the Project also has a factor in this method, as a Worker with a workload of 11 cannot be assigned a Project size >= 1.

It doesn't look like it is called anywhere else so I was wondering what is it for/do we need it? Other than that everything looks good to me | You're asking about this one, right?:
private String[] getQualificationDescriptions() 

The Worker DTO needs all of the descriptions of the Worker's qualifications in an array of strings. Qualifications don't have a getter method for the description. I could add a getter, but I'd still need to organize them into an array, so I made a function that returns a string array of the Workers qualification descriptions. Alternatively, I could add a getter to Qualification and then do the array business within Worker toDTO(). 
Wait - I remember why I didn't do the getter... the instructions said to not add new public methods (they said it will mess up their auto testing). And they didn't want us to use toString methods in the DTO. So I created a private method in worker that called Qualification's toString method and organized the descriptions into an array. A little bit of a work around on the instructions, but I didn't see another way that didn't add a public method. 

I guess I don't test private String[] getQualificationDescriptions(), which is an oversight. I can add those tests. 

Your thoughts on the approach otherwise? | I was referring to the public String getDescription() method on lines 44-47 in Qualification.java.

This could be good since these tests don't seem to agree with GitHub. I messaged Ghosh on teams about our tests failing ob GitHub despite running locally and he recommended something similar.

1) It saves on repeated lines.
2) It also gives us the exception string for more exact tests.

We could have it so that they return null. I'll see what the rest of the group would prefer. | like I explained in the team chat, why not do the checks in the method and return null that way?
you're abstracting away the check and coupling the responsibility of the check to the constructor which we shouldn't be doing here | I don't understand I thought he is already checking in the method @ChocoTonic ? if so give an example.
 | when you're viewing this method from the lens of all possible combinations of inputs for this method, does it make sense to abstract away all the checks to the method you're calling within this method? it would basically be making an assumption that the method that you're writing all the tests for this method in this test would be handled in the method would be handled by the internally called method.

by changing it to the way above, you're making it less clear what is happening in these checks and also tightly coupling the classes when you don't need to  | > I don't understand I thought he is already checking in the method @ChocoTonic ? if so give an example.

my bad I thought this was the original code by jameson that I realize now that this pr has to be made to correct it 

the checks are good, but it should be directly returning null if all the catch block is doing is returning null, unless we're doing anything extra like logging to console or file, there is no reason to wrap it all up in a large try block | I still don't understand why we need the try-catch when none of the constructors where built this way. Also my original code worked. | I would consider the structure of this application, company is implemented last because it is the highest level relative to the other classes.

also, at top level you want the caller to gracefully handle the null result of this in the case of a bad check, instead exiting the program or forcing them to use a try catch when they're using the company class methods | this kind of back and forth could be avoided by discussing what you're going to do and the context of the implementation instead of doing things on your own and waiting for feedback and wondering why there is feedback or prs published to correct the original implementation  | Alright, I got rid of the try-catch block, you convinced me about abstraction since it's much easier to test with this code.

Good point, it's an int, not an integer, so it can't be null. I will fix it and add the BCC to this PR. ",6,1,30,0

Looking at the UML, the Project can have only 0 or 1 Company. I'm not sure how to enforce this from the constructor with qualifications though. And it looks like it already is enforced in the code, being that a Company is what makes a Project using the createProject method and the Company class has a Set of Projects. ",1,1,7,0

I was thinking the search bar would match worker names and qualification names (e.g. ""J"" might match
```
[{
    ""description"": ""Java"",
    ""workers"": [""Ash""]
},{
    ""description"": ""Python"",
    ""workers"": [""James"", ""Alix""]
}]
```
), but I suppose if we can have the search string be parsed as an int then maybe it could also match qualifications with at least that many workers? Maybe certain strings are special cases like ""5-"", ""10"", ""4+"". But that would all be implementation details so I didn't include it in the diagram.

> In either case, I think your graph is also missing a node after the user sort nodes where the system clears the search string

I would argue that this is not what we want. What if a user enters a search string and gets a list of results (e.g. search for qualifications with the worker ""Calvin""), and then they want to sort by the qualifications with the least number of workers to see what Calvin's most valuable skills are? | Unless the workers associated with each qualification appear on the main qualification page, I think it is unintuitive to match non-displayed worker names with the search bar (especially if the qualifications lists is 100s of qualifications long).

Project.equals() only compares project names match.
I tried solving this issue yesterday, but it seems to be a large amount of work to truly compare if two projects are equal. I still don't think these tests are very good (do they still pass if you remove the logic to assign qualifications and project size from the implementation?), but I am not sure if there is anything that can be done about it in this amount of time | That is true, however, that really does seem like too extensive of a change to get done quickly. Moreover, there's the case of comparing sets: multiple tests compare the output of methods that return sets of created projects (and other classes) to a manually-created set. Since set equality uses the .equals method, it really seems like we're not expected to test full equality. Otherwise, we would have to, for example, turn every output set into an array and sort them before checking equality. | On the bright side, changing the implementation to used fixed parameters instead of the given ones (e.g. empty qualifications set and BIG project size) causes other tests to fail.

Okay so it is required to have at least one, however there are several methods that state if there are no qualifications, x method should return an empty set. However, when trying to implement this and test it, it is impossible to have a project without qualifications because it throws an illegal argument exception. Instead should I just shoot for catching the exception and then returning an empty set?  | I think it should be throwing an illegal argument exception. Which methods are you referring to that check for no qualifications and return an empty set?

getRequiredQualifications(): Set<Qualification>
Returns the set of all the qualifications required for the project. The order in the set is not under your control, so your tests shouldn't assume any specific ordering in the returned object. Return an empty set if there are no qualifications. | > I think it should be throwing an illegal argument exception. Which methods are you referring to that check for no qualifications and return an empty set? I know that getMissingQualificaitions is like this, but it returns a separate set by comparing 2 sets of qualifications.

I'm happy to just expect an IllegealArgumentException but the documentation is kind of confusing. In the test I have to create a Project with an empty set as Qualifications (which will then produce an IllegalStateException thus never making it to test the method itself). There's not really any way to check if there are no qualifications within the actual method. The only thing I can think of is if in my test I make a Project with one Qualification and then use ""removeQualification"" to make it an empty set. If this is the case, I'll have to implement remove qualification first.  | In the creation of a project, it is required to have a non-empty set of qualifications. The possibility of an empty set would be due to manipulation of the qualifications afterwards is how I am understanding it. | It is just a check since company can potentially remove qualifications. | > In the creation of a project, it is required to have a non-empty set of qualifications.

I agree - however I just looked and there is only an addQualification option and no removeQualification method. | Right, but it can manipulate through looking at the qualifications of its projects.  | Which would be needed as if a company were to delete a qualification, a project for that company can no longer have that same qualification. | This logic would be implemented inside createProject() to check that the project qualifications contains only qualifications belonging to the company. | > Which would be needed as if a company were to delete a qualification, a project for that company can no longer have that same qualification.

Also worker and project I think are necessary to use the assign method so I could test out the unassignAll(). | You should already know what unassignAll should return already though, yeah? Not that your implementation does not work, but it would probably be easier in the future to just compare it with the set of workers that you expect it to return. Also, isn't that thing about fail() post-hoc reasoning? If you already know the method is going to throw an exception when you input a null value, why add a test in the first place? If you were to implement the test as-is before the implementation of the method and if there was not a check for whether or not the argument is null once that method was implemented (via TDD), the test would go through to the assertEquals statement and fail there for an incorrect reason.",3,3,59,2

It sends a get projects request after the finish request, reflecting the changes made. Am I missing something? It even unassigns all the workers and the missing quals list get updated.
 | Alright that's good that those parts are working despite the problem. I checked P2 and RestController's finish is supposed to be ""finish/"" then the name path, but ours are all just ""finish"". So the request is following a generic ""finish"" path, then its working under the hood to find a match between a given name in the request body and a project in the company, and doing finish normally.

It's how you pass arguments in the path name, so something like create qualification which was given code is formatted like this.
![image](https://github.com/CS-CS415-Spring2024/t14/assets/70455926/f6b058c5-0522-4f8d-aff1-d988d9018826)
 | So the path would look like /qualifications/examplename, and the tests send data along paths like that with expected matching path descriptions and body descriptions. Our currently implementation bypasses all of this stuff for unassign, finish, assign, and start, sending them all to one path each and running the server code underneath. Technically everything works, I thought it was worse before you showed that the backend is still running on these calls without the proper path configurations. | ![image](https://github.com/CS-CS415-Spring2024/t14/assets/113632803/e8b186a8-d5a7-4ac1-b33e-b3fa9a2e0f02)

Those were specified like that, finish, start, assign, and unassign are all specified differently right?

If finish supposed to be like then wouldnt we see /api/finish/:name?

As long as the body of the request has those fields then we meet the expectations I thought. | I see that now, I didn't look at the parts for create when I checked it earlier. I'm going to rework the pr, looks like the only thing missing from restcontroller was checking for a successful finish.  | After that the error handling for the UI should be good. | > I see that now, I didn't look at the parts for create when I checked it earlier.

No, I was talking about removeQualifications in Worker and Project. This is to fix a failing TA test called testAddQualificationToActiveProject. I'm assuming it failed because our code allowed qualifications to be added to an ACTIVE project. | > > is this what you were talking about in class, the thing that was needed but wasnt in the docs?

What if the added qualification is already fulfilled by a worker on the project, then adding it and remaining active would be fine. Should adding a qualification that isn't fulfilled move the project to suspended? The spec is vague on these cases, TA's might be able to help.  | > What if the added qualification is already fulfilled by a worker on the project, then adding it and remaining active would be fine.

While I understand where you are coming from on breaking up the rest controller, the instructions for the assignment are pretty specific on how we are supposed to implement it:

1. Do not modify existing code.
2. Do not change exception handling.
3. Do not change logging.
4. Do not add public methods, exceptions, and classes. Only add private methods to the RestController.
5. Use the provided endpoints as a guide to implement all other endpoints.
6. Update the methods getQualifications() and getQualification(String description) to return the actual data from the company object.
7. If a request cannot be satisfied, throw an exception. The exception handler will take care of the rest.
8. GET requests do not have a body.
9. When returning a DTO object, all fields must be initialized with the proper values.
10. When receiving a DTO object as the body of a request, not all fields are initialized. This is specified below by ‚ÄúBody required fields‚Äù.
11. DTO objects may contain a string field that represents a Qualification, or a Worker, or a Project. The string should contain their description or name. Do not use the toString, nor the JSON representation.",1,1,58,1

It looks like you may need to run `git config --global user.name ""YOUR USERNAME""` and `git config --global user.email ""YOUR GITHUB EMAIL""`

Another thing we may want to do is get a test up that includes a project that is finished to ensure that it will not be added to the total workload count.

Maybe just a typo I don't remember, on the flip side it doesn't affect the validity of test since the first object returned is primitive which is then implicit cast to Boolean, it achieves the same result. 



> As for Worker.getWorkload() I'm a bit concerned that the switch statement doesn't have a `default` case, but maybe I'm being too fussy.

Default case doesn't matter since the switch will do nothing if it isnt 1,2, or 3 as intended. I don't know what the default case would even do since the only thing I can thing of would be error handling.
